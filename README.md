# Army Memorandum LaTeX Class

Provides a basic AR 25-50 memo in latex.

## Setup

* Requires LuaLaTeX or XeLaTeX for font handling.
* Install Arial font ("preferred" by AR 25-50 1-17)

Debian:
```bash
sudo apt-get install ttf-mscorefonts-installer
sudo fc-cache
fc-match Arial
```

Fedora:

## Usage

See `example.tex` and (TODO) template.tex.

A minimum set of declarations are required for the office-symbol, subject,
signature block, etc. After these options, within `\begin{document}` ...
`\end{document}`, the structure is based on an `enumerate` list. This is a major
break from the previous version, but much better for writing, as a good LaTeX
editor will facilitate editing the nested list. Also, I intend to tie this into
my emacs org-mode configuration eventually to further ease writing.

The basic structure looks like:

```latex
\documentclass{armymemo}

\address{Organizational Name/Title}
\address{Standardized Street Address}
\address{CITY, STATE~~12345-1234}
% AR 25-50 (10OCT2020) 5-10.b requires two spaces between state and zip.
% this can be either ` \ ` to add two spaces, or `~~` to use two non-breaking spaces.

\author{John W. Smith}\rank{CPT}\branch{CY}\title{S-3}            % optional
\officesymbol{ABC-DEF-GH}
\suspensedate{12 April 2019}                                      % optional
\signaturedate{10 April 2019}
\memoline{MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD}
\documentmark{UNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY (EXAMPLE ONLY)} % optional
\subject[(U) ]{The creation of memos using \LaTeX}
\authority{BY ORDER OF THE COMMANDER}                             % optional

% AR 25-50 mandated Arial from 2013-2020.
% The default is still Arial, but you can restore Times using:
\setmainfont{Times New Roman}

\begin{document}

\begin{enumerate}
\item This memo is a demo.
\item This item contains sub items.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Thing one.
  \item Thing two.
  \end{enumerate}
\item Point of contact is the undersigned.
\end{enumerate}

\end{document}
```

## Compile

```bash
latexmk -pdf -pvc -lualatex example.tex
```
